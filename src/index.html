  <h1>CFO Services</h1>
  <div class="text-left">
    <p>Most small and midsize businesses have a bookkeeper on staff and a tax accountant they see just a few times a year. In Financial Controlsâ€™ part-time Chief Financial Officer (CFO) services enable these businesses to have their very own experienced accounting professional on their team, just like the big businesses do to professionally and proactively manage the finances.</p>
    <p>Outsourcing these services will mean that you and your staff can spend more time on ensuring the successful operation of your business, while remaining confident that the financial side of your business is being handled by a professional.</p>
    <p>This Part Time CFO service addresses the key financial areas in the business, including profitability, managing growth, cash flow, budgeting, strategic planning, business systems, staffing and operational issues.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We work with you at a frequency determined by the needs of the business. This could be
    weekly, fortnightly, monthly or quarterly.
      <li>We assist with the preparation and analysis of monthly reporting packages that have been
    customised for your business. Monthly reporting packages include:
      <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li>Profit and Loss
        <li>Balance sheet
        <li>Cash flow forecast
        <li>Key Performance indicators
      </ol>
      <li>Or attend to any other special accounting project you might have in your business
    </ol>

    <h2>Stealth Bikes</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>Stealth Electric Bikes is an up and coming business that has developed electric powered mountain bikes capable of reaching speeds in excess of 50 km/hr. Recently the company has attracted significant venture capital but the management reporting at that time was not sufficient to meet investor requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <p>CFO services were engaged to help with this situation, and results were quickly achieved, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Establishment of a base for the existing reports by ensuring all balance sheet accounts were fully reconciled and that the profit and loss accounts reflected the requirements of the business.
      <li>Development of a management reporting pack which included profit and loss, balance sheet and management dashboard for key business metrics (including order taken, units shipped and cost of manufacture for each of the bike type sold).
      <li>Introduction of a stock management system and bills of material for production and stock management.
      <li>Development of cash flow forecasts for working capital management.
